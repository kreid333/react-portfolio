# React Portfolio


## Description 

For this project, I had to create a react portfolio website that would accomodate for (and still look good on) all devices. To accomplish this task, I used Bootstrap and utilized their grid system to position various elements onto the pages that I created. I also used custom CSS for certain styling that would assist with making the page more responsive and visually appealing.

From there, the user can scroll through my portfolio to access my projects, what technologies I am proficient in, an about me, and a contact form with contact information.
